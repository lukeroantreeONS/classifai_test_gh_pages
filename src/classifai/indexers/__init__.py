"""This module provides functionality for creating a vector index from a CSV (text)
file.
It defines the `VectorStore` class, which is used to model and create vector databases
from CSV text files using a vectoriser object.

This class requires a Vectoriser object from the vectorisers submodule,
to convert the CSV's text data into vector embeddings which are then stored in the
VectorStore objects.

Key Features:
- Batch processing of input files to handle large datasets.
- Support for CSV file format (additional formats may be added in future updates).
- Integration with a custom embedder for generating vector embeddings.
- Logging for tracking progress and handling errors during processing.

VectorStore Class:
- The `VectorStore` class is initialized with a vectoriser object and a CSV knowledgebase.
- Additional columns in the CSV may be specified as metadata to be included in the vector database.
- Upon creation, the VectorStore is saved in parquet format for efficient, and quick
  reloading via the VectorStore's `.from_filespace()` method.
- A new piece of text data (or label) can be queried against the VectorStore in the following ways:
    - `.search()`: to find the most semantically similar pieces of text in the vector database.
    - `.reverse_search()`: to find all examples in the knowledgebase that have a given label.
    - `.embed()`: to generate a vector embedding for a given piece of text data.
- 'Hook' methods may be specified to perform pre-processing on input data before embedding,
  and post-processing on the output of the search methods.
