"""This module provides classes for creating and utilizing embedding models from user-created solutions or
third-party services.
The Vectoriser module offers a unified interface to interact with various other ClassifAI Package Modules.
Generally Vectorisers are used to convert text data into numerical embeddings that can be used for
machine learning tasks.

# Vectoriser Overview

In our Package, Vectoriser have a simple role:

  * Take in text data (as a string or list of strings)
  * Output numerical embeddings (as a numpy array)
  * Each Vectortiser should provide a `transform` method to perform this conversion.

It is possible for users to implement their own Vectoriser classes by inheriting from the
`VectoriserBase` abstract base class and implementing the `transform` method.

# Implemented Vectorisers

We provide several robust implementations of Vectorisers that interface with popular services and libraries.

The module contains the following 'ready-made' classes:

  * `GcpVectoriser`: A class for embedding text using Google Cloud Platform's GenAI API.
  * `HuggingFaceVectoriser`: A general wrapper class for Huggingface Transformers
    models to generate text embeddings.
  * `OllamaVectoriser`: A general wrapper class for using a locally running ollama
    server to generate text embeddings.

Each class is designed to interface with a specific service that provides embedding model
functionality.

The `GcpVectoriser` class leverages Google's GenAI API,

The `HuggingFaceVectoriser` class utilizes models from the Huggingface Transformers library.

The `OllamaVectoriser` class can use any local/downloaded model which can be served by ollama.

These classes abstract the underlying implementation details, providing a simple and consistent
interface for embedding text using different services.

instructions / examples on implementation of  custom `Vectoriser`s, and using them to within `VectorStore`
objects.
