# Demo for `classifai`

This directory contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you understand and use `classifai` effectively.

## Prerequisites

You may wish to download each notebook individually and the demo dataset individually - each notebook contains specific installation instructions on how to set up an environemnt and download the package

## Running the Demo

To start the demo, launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from your terminal in this directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or, if you prefer JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then, open the notebooks in your browser. 
We recommend going through the the `general_workflow_demo.ipynb` notebook for a broad overview of the package before moving onto the `custom_vectoriser.ipynb` notebook, which covers a more advanced use-case.

## Notebooks Overview

This demo includes two Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `general_workflow_demo.ipynb`

This introduces the core features of `classifai`.

It covers:

*   Importing the package and its main components.

*   Initialising a Vectoriser for converting text to vector representation.

*   Creating a VectorStore - a database of labelled examples, and their vector representations, linked with a Vectoriser to allow supplied text to be searched against the vector database using cosine similarity to rank the labelled examples in order of semantic similarity.

*   Creating a FastAPI server to expose the VectorStore's functionality via a REST API.

This notebook is intended for prospective users to get a quick overview of what the package can do, and as a 'jumping off point' for new projects.

### 2. `custom_vectoriser.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to create a new, custom Vectoriser by extending the base `VectoriserBase` class.

It covers:

*   Creating a new `OneHotVectoriser` class, extended from `VectoriserBase`.

*   Setting up a VectorStore which uses the new Vectoriser.

This notebook is for users who want to implement a vectorisation approach not covered by our existing suite of Vectorisers.

### 3. `custom_preprocessing_and_postprocessing_hooks.ipynb`

This notebook demostrates how to add custom Python code logic to the VectorStore search pipeline, such as performing spell checking on user input, without breaking the data flow of the ClassifAI VectorStore.

It covers:

* How the VectorStore handles input data and output data

* How to write 'hooks' - Python functions that can manipulate the input and output data of the different VectorStore methods

* How to ensure your hooks don't break the dataflow by following the required input and output dataclasses

* Examples of different kinds of hooks that can be written - [spellchecking, deduplicating results, adding extra info to results based on result ids]
